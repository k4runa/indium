## Unified interface, native power

Indium is more than just a renderer; it's a complete development environment. It provides a comprehensive set of tools designed to let developers focus on gameplay and storytelling without reinventing the core foundations.

### High-Performance Native Scripting
Indium features a robust **Dynamic Scripting API** based on C++20. Scripts are compiled into native shared libraries (`.dylib` on macOS, `.so` on Linux, `.dll` on Windows) and hot-reloaded by the engine at runtime. The engine compiles them with the exact toolchain it was built with — Apple clang, clang, or g++ — so iteration is near-instant while maintaining the raw performance of native C++.

The scripting API is modeled after Unity's MonoBehaviour pattern. Scripts expose editable properties to the Inspector via the `IND_PROP` macro without any boilerplate.

### Narrative-First Architecture
At its core, Indium is built for stories. The integrated **StoryState Blackboard** provides a global, persistent space for narrative flags and variables. Combined with per-scene authored state and a multi-slot **Save/Load system**, creating complex branching narratives is part of the engine's DNA.

### Visual Editor & Tooling
The Indium Editor offers a professional-grade suite of tools:
- **Scene Hierarchy & Inspector:** Deep-dive into entity properties and component state with real-time editing and full undo/redo support.
- **Viewport Interaction:** Pixel-accurate mouse mapping, camera panning, and specialized 2.5D depth ordering (Y-Sorting).
- **Asset Management:** An integrated Content Browser for quick access to scenes, textures, scripts, and prefabs.
- **Integrated Console:** Real-time log capture from both the engine core and your custom scripts.
- **Play / Pause / Stop:** Non-destructive simulation using scene snapshots — your authored state is never overwritten during testing.

## Features at a Glance

### Physics & Collision
- **SAT-Based OBB Detection:** Accurate narrow-phase polygon-polygon and circle-polygon collision.
- **Impulse Resolution:** Restitution (bounciness), mass ratios, and angular impulse per collision.
- **Baumgarte Stabilization:** Position correction to eliminate penetration jitter.
- **Sleep State:** Bodies with negligible velocity are suspended automatically to save CPU.
- **Spatial Grid Broad-Phase:** O(N) collision candidate lookup instead of O(N²) brute force.
- **32 Collision Layers:** Per-body layer assignment and bitmask filtering.
- **Collision & Trigger Callbacks:** `OnCollisionEnter2D` / `Stay` / `Exit` and `OnTriggerEnter2D` / `Exit` dispatched directly to scripts.
- **Physics Queries:** `Raycast`, `OverlapCircle`, and `OverlapBox` callable from any script.

### Scripting API
Scripts derive from `NativeScript` and override lifecycle hooks:

| Hook | When it runs |
|---|---|
| `OnAwake` | Once, before the first frame |
| `OnStart` | Once, on the first frame |
| `OnUpdate(dt)` | Every frame |
| `OnFixedUpdate(fixedDt)` | Every fixed physics step (60 Hz) |
| `OnLateUpdate(dt)` | After all updates |
| `OnDraw` | During the draw phase (world space) |
| `OnGUI` | Screen-space UI pass, each frame in Play/Pause (after the world is drawn) |
| `OnDestroy` | When the entity is destroyed |

Additional script capabilities:
- **Coroutines:** `StartCoroutine(task)` with `co_await WaitForSeconds{n}`, `WaitForFrames{n}`, and `WaitUntil{fn}`.
- **Entity Management:** `Spawn<T>()`, `Destroy()`, `FindByName()`, `FindById()`.
- **Component Queries:** `GetComponent<T>()`, `AddComponent<T>()`, `FindObjectOfType<T>()`, `FindObjectsOfType<T>()`.
- **Scene Transitions:** `LoadScene("level2")` — transitions at end of frame.
- **Prefab Instantiation:** `InstantiatePrefab("enemy")` — spawns from a saved `.prefab` file.
- **Input:** `InputManager::Get().IsActionPressed("jump")` with JSON-configured key/mouse bindings.
- **Runtime UI:** override `OnGUI()` to draw a screen-space HUD / menu with `GUI::Box`, `GUI::Label`, `GUI::Button`, `GUI::Image`, sized via `Screen::Width()` / `Screen::Height()`.
- **Application control:** `Quit()` immediately exits.

### Built-in Components

| Component | Description |
|---|---|
| `RigidbodyComponent` | Physics body: Dynamic / Kinematic / Static. Gravity, drag, mass, bounciness, angular velocity. |
| `BoxCollider2D` | Rectangle collision shape with offset and OBB support. |
| `CircleCollider2D` | Circle collision shape. Circle-polygon narrow phase included. |
| `TriggerComponent` | Non-physical overlap zone; fires `OnTriggerEnter2D` / `Exit` on scripts. |
| `CameraComponent` | Attaches the game camera to an entity for smooth following. |
| `AnimatorComponent` | Frame-based sprite sheet animation with configurable speed and looping. |
| `SpriteRendererComponent` | Renders a texture on an entity with tint and scaling. |
| `ShapeRendererComponent` | Draws a solid rectangle or circle primitive using the entity's color and scale. |
| `TextRendererComponent` | Renders a text string in world space; supports custom TTF/OTF fonts, size, letter spacing, alignment, and color. |
| `AudioSourceComponent` | Plays audio files. Two modes: **Sound** (in-memory SFX, can overlap) and **Music** (disk-streamed for long tracks). |
| `ParticleSystemComponent` | CPU particle emitter. Configurable shape (Point / Circle / Rectangle), lifetime, velocity, color gradient, and size over lifetime. |
| `TilemapComponent` | Grid-based tilemap renderer. Loads a tileset texture and renders a `cols × rows` tile grid. Tile index -1 is empty. |
| `BouncerComponent` | Simple wall-bounce behaviour; keeps entities within world bounds. |
| `InteractableComponent` | Marks an entity as interactable: prompt, radius, and an optional flag / dialogue / event fired on interact. |
| `PlayerInteractorComponent` | Attach to the player; shows the nearest interactable's prompt and triggers it on the Interact action (falls back to `E`). |

### Scene System
- **Multi-Scene Workflow:** Create, open, and switch between scenes from the editor.
- **Runtime Scene Loading:** `LoadScene("name")` transitions at end of frame from any script.
- **Y-Sorting:** Automatic depth ordering for isometric and top-down perspectives.
- **Entity Hierarchy:** Parent/child transforms with recursive position, rotation, and scale propagation.
- **Prefab System:** Save any entity as a `.prefab` file and instantiate it at runtime via scripts or the editor.

### Narrative & Persistence
- **StoryState Blackboard:** Global key-value store (bool, int, float, string) for narrative flags and game variables. Authored per-scene starting values that are seeded when Play begins.
- **Dialogue System:** Branching dialogue graphs authored as `dialogue/<name>.json` and run at runtime via `DialogueManager::Get().Start("name")`. Choices read/write StoryState (`requireFlag` / `setFlag`) and fire `NarrativeEvent`s; the box renders in the screen-space UI pass.
- **Interaction:** `InteractableComponent` + `PlayerInteractorComponent` provide "press to interact" prompts that set flags, start dialogues, or fire events — complementing the automatic `TriggerComponent` zones.
- **Save/Load Manager:** Slot-based persistence (`slot_0.json`, `slot_1.json`, …) stored alongside the project. Saves and restores the full StoryState.

## Writing a Script

```cpp
#include "NativeScript.hpp"

class Player : public Indium::NativeScript
{
    IND_PROP(float, speed, 200.0f);
    IND_PROP(bool,  doubleJump, false);

    REGISTER_SCRIPT(Player)

    void OnStart() override
    {
        StartCoroutine(IntroSequence());
    }

    void OnUpdate(float dt) override
    {
        if (InputManager::Get().IsActionPressed("jump"))
            entity->velocity.y = -400.0f;

        entity->position.x += InputManager::Get().GetAxis("horizontal") * speed * dt;
    }

    void OnCollisionEnter2D(Entity* other) override
    {
        if (other->name == "Coin")
        {
            StoryState::Get().Set("coins", StoryState::Get().GetInt("coins") + 1);
            Destroy(other);
        }
    }

    CoroutineTask IntroSequence()
    {
        co_await Indium::WaitForSeconds{1.5f};
        auto* txt = GetComponent<TextRendererComponent>();
        if (txt) txt->text = "Go!";
    }
};

INDIUM_EXPORT_SCRIPTS(Player)
```

## Authoring Dialogue

Dialogue lives in `dialogue/<name>.json` and runs via `DialogueManager::Get().Start("name")` — from a script, or automatically by setting an `InteractableComponent`'s **Dialogue Id**:

```json
{
  "start": "greet",
  "nodes": {
    "greet": {
      "speaker": "Alice",
      "text": "Have we met before?",
      "choices": [
        { "text": "In the village.",   "next": "remember", "requireFlag": "met_in_village" },
        { "text": "I don't think so.",  "next": "intro",    "setFlag": "denied_meeting" },
        { "text": "[Leave]",            "next": "" }
      ]
    },
    "intro":    { "speaker": "Alice", "text": "Well met. I'm Alice.", "next": "" },
    "remember": { "speaker": "Alice", "text": "Good to see you again!", "next": "" }
  }
}
```

- A node with **no visible choices** is narration — advance with **Space / Enter / click**; choice nodes accept **mouse or number keys 1–9**.
- `requireFlag` hides a choice until that StoryState flag is set; `setFlag` sets a flag when chosen (and fires a `NarrativeEvent`).
- `next: ""` ends the dialogue. The box is drawn by the engine in the screen-space UI pass during Play.
